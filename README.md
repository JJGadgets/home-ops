## Overview

This repository is for my home K3s cluster, which is a lightweight version of K8s. It's based off of the k8s-at-home [flux template](https://github.com/onedr0p/flux-cluster-template).
It's supported by [k3s](https://k3s.io) cluster with [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) backed by [Flux](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/) and [SOPS](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/guides/mozilla-sops/).

The purpose here is to learn k8s, while practicing Gitops.

Big shout out to original flux template, and the k8s-at-home discord.

[@whazor](https://github.com/whazor) created [this website](https://nanne.dev/k8s-at-home-search/) as a creative way to search Helm Releases across GitHub. You may use it as a means to get ideas on how to configure an applications' Helm values.
